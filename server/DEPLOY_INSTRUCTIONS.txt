SERVER DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
==============================

Since your Hostinger plan cannot run the Node.js server, we will use Render.com (it's free).

STEP 1: PREPARE THE SERVER CODE
-------------------------------
1.  I have already created a `server` folder in your workspace.
2.  This folder contains `server.js`, `package.json`, and `render.yaml`.
3.  You need to upload ONLY this `server` folder to a GitHub repository.
    - Create a new repo on GitHub (e.g., "my-game-server").
    - Upload the files inside `server/` to it.

STEP 2: DEPLOY TO RENDER
------------------------
1.  Go to https://render.com and sign up.
2.  Click "New +" -> "Web Service".
3.  Connect your GitHub account and select the repository you just created.
4.  Render will auto-detect the settings (Node.js). 
5.  Click "Create Web Service".
6.  Wait for it to deploy. It will give you a URL like: `https://my-game-server.onrender.com`.
7.  COPY THIS URL.

STEP 3: CONNECT THE GAME
------------------------
1.  Go back to your `game_deploy` folder.
2.  Open `js/network.js`.
3.  Find the line at the top:
    `const PRODUCTION_SERVER_URL = "https://REPLACE-ME-WITH-YOUR-RENDER-URL.onrender.com";`
4.  Paste your Render URL there.
    Example: `const PRODUCTION_SERVER_URL = "https://cool-game-123.onrender.com";`
5.  Save the file.

STEP 4: UPLOAD GAME TO HOSTINGER
--------------------------------
1.  Now upload the modified `game_deploy` folder contents to Hostinger's `public_html`.
2.  Done! Players will connect automatically without typing the URL.
